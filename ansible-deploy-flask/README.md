Ansible playbooks to deploy flask apps.

## Setup

Create an `inventory` file.

A first playbook sets up Python & NGINX:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory install_base.yml -K
```

`-K` is used to request for BECOME password.

## Deploy an app

An example is provided [here](deploy_test.yml):

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory deploy_test.yml -K
```

Variables are defined [here](group_vars/all.yml) and can be changed to deploy another app.

## TODO

- [ ] logrotate?
- [ ] static? â†’ I cannot do it.
- [ ] [goaccess](https://goaccess.io/)? (with `.htaccess`, maybe? :p )
- [x] skip certificate?
- [x] update? 
- [x] more proxy params?
